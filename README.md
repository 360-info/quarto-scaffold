### Reproduce the analysis

<!-- These instructions are for analysis and charts done in R. If you've used something else, replace this section. -->

Our analyses are done in [R](http://r-project.org) and can be found in the `*.r` and `*.rmd` files.

The `renv.lock` file can be used with the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) or [`capsule`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/capsule) packages to recreate the R package dependencies.
