# quarto-scaffold

Base a new repo off this public template to get started with a reproducible analysis or graphic quickly. The template comes with a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) in order to get working with 360's data science stack quickly.

## ðŸ›  Get started

To start working with a preconfigured, reproducible environment:

- Clone this repository
- Open it in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run **"Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"**
- The project will now be open in a container that includes Quarto, R and the packages needed to reproduce the analysis

## âž• Adding stories

This repo just keeps the dev environment scaffolding; templates for individual analyses and graphics are kept in the [`quarto-examples`] repo. To bring one of them into your project with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), run (for example):

```shell
quarto use extension 360-info/quarto-examples/360analysis
```
