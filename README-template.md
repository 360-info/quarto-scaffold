## Reproduce the analysis

We typically publish graphics using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) notebooks, which can be found in the`*.qmd` files. Quarto allows reproducible analysis and visualisation to be done in a mix of languages, but we typically use [R](https://r-project,.org) and [Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript).

You'll need to:
- [Download and install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started)
- [Download the install R](https://www.r-project.org)
- Satisfy the R package dependencies. In R:
  * Install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) package with `install.packages("renv")`,
  * Then run `renv::restore()` to install the R package dependencies.
  * (For problems satisfying R package dependencies, refer to [Quarto's documentation on virtual environments](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).)

Now, render the `.qmd` files to the `/out` directory with:

```sh
quarto render
```
